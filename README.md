# Chatbot - Senkada raya
Kandyan drum being an epitome of Sri Lankan drumming culture is being 
transformed into a form of entertainment, where the original essence of the culture 
is perhaps getting overlooked. The preservation and conservation of these graceful 
cultures is indeed challenging and should find ways to preserve, conserve and raise 
awareness about the musical culture within the community. In attempt of resolving 
these issues, the chatbot called Senkada raya is proposed. Senkada raya is 
constructed to provide the originality, while raising the awareness and interest 
about the Kandyan drum. The chatbot was designed and deployed using Botpress, 
where the chatbot is web based and could be accessed freely. The testing and the 
deployment for the chatbot was performed, where the limitations and the future 
suggestions are addressed in latter.
